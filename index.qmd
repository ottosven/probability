# Welcome {-}

This tutorial gives a short introduction of the most important basic concepts from probability theory and statistics for econometricians.
<!-- The sections are complemented with short R sessions. -->

<!-- To learn R or refresh your skills, please check out my tutorial [**Getting Started With R**](https://rintro.svenotto.com). -->

This tutorial is still under construction.
The two sections presented here are the first two sections of my course Statistics for Data Analytics from the winter term 2023.
