# Welcome {-}

This tutorial provides a concise introduction to the fundamental concepts of probability theory for econometricians and data scientists.

The tutorial keeps the measure-theoretic details of probability theory to a minimum, focusing instead on the practical aspects of probability theory that are most relevant for econometricians.

<!-- For a quick foundational review, I recommend sections 2 and 3 of Stock and Watson (2019): [Textbook Link](https://elibrary.pearson.de/book/99.150005/9781292264523) -->
