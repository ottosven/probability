We distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables. Discrete random variables have only countably many potential outcomes (e.g., integers) whereas continuous random variables may produce any real number.\n\nExamples of random variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nPotential outcomes\nType\n\n\n\n\nCoin flip\nC=1 (heads), C=0 (tails)\ndiscrete\n\n\nDice\nD \\in \\{1,...,12\\}\ndiscrete\n\n\nYears of schooling\nY \\in \\{0,1,2,...\\}\ndiscrete\n\n\nStock returns\nR \\in \\mathbb R\ncontinuous\n\n\nWages\nW \\geq 0\ncontinuous",

    "text": "1.2 Events\nThe coin flip random experiment has two potential outcomes, which are 0 and 1. The set S of all potential outcome values is called the sample space, i.e., S = \\{0,1\\}. An event is a collection of outcomes and therefore a subset of the sample space. Any outcome is an event, the collection of all outcomes is an event, any union of multiple events is an event, and the complement of an event is an event. Thus, \\{0\\} and \\{1\\} are events, the union \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0,1\\} = S is an event, and the complement \\{0,1 \\}^c = \\{ \\} = \\varnothing (empty set) is an event. The collection of all events is called sigma algebra, which in our case is \n\\mathcal B = \\{ \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\varnothing \\}.\n The sigma algebra of a discrete random variable with n different potential outcomes contains 2^n different events.\nA continuous random variable has the sample space S = \\mathbb R (stock returns example) or a subset of the real line, e.g. S = [0,\\infty) as in the wage example. There are an uncountable infinite number of events, which are collected in the so called Borel sigma algebra. It contains all open, half-open, and closed intervals of outcomes, and their unions, intersections, and complements. Here are some examples of events: [-1, 1], (2,\\infty), (0, 2/3] \\cup [3 \\cup 4), \\{0.5\\}.",

    "text": "1.3 Probability distribution\nThe value of a random variable is determined by chance. It can be described by a probability distribution P, which assigns a probability to each event in \\mathcal B. A fair coin has the following probability distribution: \n  P(C=0) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(C=1) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(C\\in\\{0,1\\}) = 1, \\quad P(C \\in \\varnothing) = 0.\n\nFor the concept of a probability distribution to be coherent, Andrey Kolmogorov formulated the axioms of probability. Let X be a random variable with sample space S and sigma algebra \\mathcal B. Then,\n\nP(X \\in A) \\geq 0 for all events A \\in \\mathcal B,\nP(X \\in S) = 1,\nP(X \\in \\bigcup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty P(X \\in A_i) for any disjoint sequence A_1, A_2, \\ldots \\in \\mathcal B\n\nThe three axioms of probability imply the following rules of calculation:",
