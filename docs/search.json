Any summary statistic we compute – like a sample mean, sample correlation, or OLS coefficient – is simply a function of these numbers.\nThese statistics provide a snapshot of the data at hand but do not automatically reveal broader insights about the world. To add deeper meaning to these numbers, identify dependencies, and understand causalities, we must consider how the data were obtained.\nA random experiment is an experiment whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. In statistical theory, any dataset is viewed as the result of such a random experiment. While individual outcomes are unpredictable, patterns emerge when experiments are repeated.\nThe gender of the next person you meet, daily fluctuations in stock prices, monthly music streams of your favorite artist, or the annual number of pizzas consumed – all involve a certain amount of randomness and emerge from random experiments. Probability theory gives us the tools to analyze this randomness systematically.",

    "text": "1.2 Random Variables\nA random variable is a numerical summary of a random experiment. An outcome is a specific result of a random experiment. The sample space S is the set/collection of all potential outcomes.\nLet’s consider some examples:\n\nCoin toss: The outcome of a coin toss can be “heads” or “tails”. This random experiment has a two-element sample space: S = \\{heads, tails\\}. We can express the experiment as a binary random variable: \nY = \\begin{cases}\n1   & \\text{if outcome is heads,} \\\\\n0   & \\text{if outcome is tails.}\n\\end{cases}\n\nGender: If you conduct a survey and interview a random person to ask them about their gender, the answer may be “female”, “male”, or “diverse”. It is a random experiment since the person to be interviewed is selected randomly. The sample space has three elements: S = \\{female, male, diverse\\}. To focus on female vs. non-female, we can define the female dummy variable: \nY = \\begin{cases}\n1   & \\text{if the person is female,} \\\\\n0   & \\text{if the person is not female.}\n\\end{cases}\n Similarly, dummy variables for male and diverse can be defined.\nEducation level: If you ask a random person about their education level according to the ISCED-2011 framework, the outcome may be one of the eight ISCED-2011 levels. We have an eight-element sample space: S = \\{Level \\ 1, Level \\ 2, Level \\ 3, Level \\ 4, Level \\ 5, Level \\ 6, Level \\ 7, Level \\ 8\\}.\n\nThe eight-element sample space of the education-level random experiment provides a natural ordering. We define the random variable education as the number of years of schooling of the interviewed person, with values corresponding to typical completion times in the German education system: \n  Y = \\text{years of schooling} \\in \\{4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21\\}.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: ISCED 2011 levels\n\n\n\n\nISCED level\nEducation level\nYears of schooling\n\n\n\n1\nPrimary\n4\n\n\n2\nLower Secondary\n10\n\n\n3\nUpper secondary\n12\n\n\n4\nPost-Secondary\n13\n\n\n5\nShort-Cycle Tertiary\n14\n\n\n6\nBachelor’s\n16\n\n\n7\nMaster’s\n18\n\n\n8\nDoctoral\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWage: If you ask a random person about their income per working hour in EUR, there are infinitely many potential answers. Any (non-negative) real number may be an outcome. The sample space is a continuum of different wage levels. The wage level of the interviewed person is already numerical. The random variable is \nY = \\text{income per working hour in EUR}.\n\n\n\nRandom variables share the characteristic that their value is uncertain before conducting a random experiment (e.g., flipping a coin or selecting a random person for an interview). Their value is always a real number and is determined only once the experiment’s outcome is known.",

    "section": "\n1.3 Events and Probabilities",
    "text": "1.3 Events and Probabilities\nTo quantify the uncertainty in random variables, we need to assign probabilities to different possible outcomes or sets of outcomes. This is where events and probability functions come into play.\nAn event of a random variable Y is a specific subset of the real line. Any real number defines an event (elementary event), and any open, half-open, or closed interval represents an event as well.\nLet’s define some specific events:\n\nElementary events: \n  A_1 = \\{Y=0\\}, \\quad A_2 = \\{Y=1\\}, \\quad A_3 = \\{Y=2.5\\}\n\nHalf-open events: \\begin{align*}\nA_4 &= \\{Y \\geq 0\\} = \\{ Y \\in [0,\\infty) \\} \\\\\nA_5 &= \\{ -1 \\leq Y &lt; 1 \\} = \\{ Y \\in [-1,1) \\}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe probability function P assigns values between 0 and 1 to events. For a fair coin toss (where Y=1 represents heads and Y=0 represents tails), it is natural to assign the following probabilities: \n  P(A_1) = P(Y=0) = 0.5, \\quad P(A_2) = P(Y=1) = 0.5\n\nBy definition, the coin variable will never take the value 2.5, so we assign \n  P(A_3) = P(Y=2.5) = 0\n\nTo assign probabilities to interval events, we check whether the elementary events \\{Y=0\\} and/or \\{Y=1\\} are subsets of the event of interest:\n\nIf both \\{Y=0\\} and \\{Y=1\\} are contained in the event of interest, the probability is 1\nIf only one of them is contained, the probability is 0.5\nIf neither is contained, the probability is 0\n\nFor our examples: \n  P(A_4) = P(Y \\geq 0) = 1, \\quad P(A_5) = P(-1 \\leq Y &lt; 1) = 0.5\n\nEvery event has a complementary event (denoted with superscript c), which consists of all outcomes not in the original event. For any pair of events, we can also take the union (denoted by \\cup) and intersection (denoted by \\cap). Let’s define further events:\n\nComplement (all outcomes not in the original event): \nA_6 = A_4^c = \\{Y \\geq 0\\}^c = \\{Y &lt; 0\\} = \\{Y \\in (-\\infty, 0)\\}\n\nUnion (outcomes in either event): \nA_7 = A_1 \\cup A_6 = \\{Y=0\\} \\cup \\{Y&lt; 0\\} = \\{Y \\leq 0\\}\n\nIntersection (outcomes in both events): \nA_8 = A_4 \\cap A_5 = \\{Y \\geq 0\\} \\cap \\{-1 \\leq Y &lt; 1\\} = \\{0 \\leq Y &lt; 1\\}\n\nCombinations of multiple events: \\begin{align*}\nA_9 &= A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup A_5 \\cup A_6 \\cup A_7 \\cup A_8 \\\\\n&= \\{Y \\in (-\\infty, 1] \\cup \\{2.5\\}\\}\n\\end{align*}\nCertain event (contains all possible outcomes): \nA_{10} = A_9 \\cup A_9^c = \\{Y \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\} = \\{Y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n\nEmpty event (contains no outcomes): \nA_{11} = A_{10}^c = \\{Y \\notin \\mathbb{R}\\} = \\{\\}\n\n\nFor the coin toss experiment, we can verify the probabilities of all these events:\n\n\nP(A_1) = 0.5 (probability of tails)\n\nP(A_2) = 0.5 (probability of heads)\n\nP(A_3) = 0 (coin never shows 2.5)\n\nP(A_4) = 1 (coin always shows a non-negative value)\n\nP(A_5) = 0.5 (only tails falls in this interval)\n\nP(A_6) = 0 (coin never shows a negative value)\n\nP(A_7) = 0.5 (same as probability of tails)\n\nP(A_8) = 0.5 (contains only tails)\n\nP(A_9) = 1 (contains all possible coin outcomes)\n\nP(A_{10}) = 1 (the certain event always occurs)\n\nP(A_{11}) = 0 (the empty event never occurs)\n\nTo illustrate how events and probabilities apply in other contexts, consider our education level example. If Y represents years of schooling with possible values \\{4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21\\}, we might define the event B = \\{Y \\geq 16\\} representing “has at least a Bachelor’s degree.” The probability P(B) would then represent the proportion of the population with at least a Bachelor’s degree.",

The probability function P assigns probabilities to events within the Borel sigma-algebra (denoted as \\mathcal B), which contains all events we would ever need to compute probabilities for in practice. This includes our previously mentioned events A_1, \\ldots, A_{11}, any interval of the form \\{ Y \\in (a,b) \\} with a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}, and all possible unions, intersections, and complements of these events.\nTwo events A and B are disjoint if A \\cap B = \\{\\}, meaning they have no common outcomes.

The remaining properties follow as logical consequences of these axioms.\nLet’s consider a practical example: In our education survey, suppose we know the following probabilities:\n\nP(\\text{Primary education}) = 0.1\nP(\\text{Secondary education}) = 0.6\nP(\\text{Tertiary education}) = 0.3\n\nThese events are disjoint (a person cannot simultaneously have exactly primary and exactly secondary education as their highest level), and they cover all possibilities (everyone has some highest level of education). Using the axioms:\n\nEach probability is non-negative (satisfying axiom 1)\nThe sum 0.1 + 0.6 + 0.3 = 1 (satisfying axiom 2)\nThe probability of having either primary or secondary education is P(\\text{Primary or Secondary}) = P(\\text{Primary}) + P(\\text{Secondary}) = 0.1 + 0.6 = 0.7 (using axiom 3 for disjoint events)\n\nFrom the implied properties, we can also calculate that the probability of not having tertiary education is P(\\text{No tertiary}) = 1 - P(\\text{Tertiary}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.",

    "text": "1.5 Distribution Function\nAssigning probabilities to events is straightforward for binary variables, like coin tosses. For instance, knowing that P(Y = 1) = 0.5 allows us to derive the probabilities for all events in \\mathcal B.\nHowever, for more complex variables, such as education or wage, defining probabilities for all possible events becomes more challenging due to the vast number of potential set operations involved.\nFortunately, it turns out that knowing the probabilities of events of the form \\{Y \\leq a\\} is enough to determine the probabilities of all other events. These probabilities are summarized in the cumulative distribution function.\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable Y is \n  F(a) := P(Y \\leq a), \\quad a \\in \\mathbb R.\n\n\n\nThe CDF is sometimes simply referred to as the distribution function, or the distribution.\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the variable coin is \n  F(a) = \\begin{cases}\n    0 & a &lt; 0, \\\\\n    0.5 & 0 \\leq a &lt; 1, \\\\\n    1 & a \\geq 1,\n  \\end{cases}\n\\tag{1.1}\nwith the following CDF plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: CDF of coin (discrete random variable)\n\n\nThe CDF of the variable education could be:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: CDF of education (discrete random variable)\n\n\nand the CDF of the variable wage may have the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: CDF of wage (continuous random variable)\n\n\nNotice the key difference: the CDF of a continuous random variable (like wage) is smooth, while the CDF of a discrete random variable (like coin and education) contains jumps and is flat between these jumps. The height of each jump corresponds to the probability of that specific value occurring.\nAny function F(a) with the following properties defines a valid probability distribution:\n\nNon-decreasing: F(a) \\leq F(b) for a \\leq b.\nReflects the monotonicity of probability when the event \\{Y \\leq a\\} is contained in \\{Y \\leq b\\} for a &lt; b.\nLimits at 0 and 1: \\displaystyle \\lim_{a \\to -\\infty} F(a) = 0 and \\displaystyle \\lim_{a \\to \\infty} F(a) = 1.\nEnsures the total probability equals 1 and impossible events have zero probability.\nRight-continuity: \\displaystyle \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0, \\varepsilon &gt; 0} F(a + \\varepsilon) = F(a).\nEnsures P(Y \\leq a) includes P(Y = a), which matters especially for discrete variables with jumps in the CDF.\n\nBy the basic rules of probability, we can compute the probability of any event of interest if we know the CDF F(a). Here are the most common calculations:\n\nProbability Calculations Using the CDF (for a &lt; b):\n\nP(Y \\leq a) = F(a)\nP(Y &gt; a) = 1 - F(a)\nP(Y &lt; a) = F(a) - P(Y=a)\nP(Y \\geq a) = 1 - P(Y &lt; a)\nP(a &lt; Y \\leq b) = F(b) - F(a)\nP(a &lt; Y &lt; b) = F(b) - F(a) - P(Y=b)\nP(a \\leq Y \\leq b) = F(b) - F(a) + P(Y=a)\nP(a \\leq Y &lt; b) = F(b) - F(a)\n\n\n\nThe point probability P(Y = a) represents the size of the jump at a in the CDF F(a): \nP(Y=a) = F(a) - \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0, \\varepsilon &gt; 0} F(a-\\varepsilon),\n which is the jump height at a. For continuous random variables, point probabilities are always zero, while for discrete random variables, they can be positive.\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0, \\varepsilon &gt; 0} F(a - \\varepsilon) denotes the left limit at a while \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0, \\varepsilon &gt; 0} F(a+\\varepsilon) denotes the right limit at a. When approaching from the left, the CDF can have a jump, while when approaching from the right, the CDF cannot jump (due to right-continuity).\nLet’s use our coin toss example to illustrate how to calculate different probabilities using the CDF in Equation 1.1:\n\nP(Y \\leq 0.5) = F(0.5) = 0.5\nP(Y &gt; 0.5) = 1 - F(0.5) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\nP(Y = 0) = F(0) - \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0, \\varepsilon &gt; 0} F(0-\\varepsilon) = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5\nP(-1 &lt; Y \\leq 2) = F(2) - F(-1) = 1 - 0 = 1",

Instead, they are described by the probability density function (PDF), which serves as the continuous analogue. If the CDF is differentiable, the PDF is given by its derivative:\n\nProbability Density Function (PDF)\nThe probability density function (PDF) or simply density function of a continuous random variable Y is the derivative of its CDF: \n    f(a) = \\frac{d}{da} F(a).\n\nConversely, the CDF can be obtained from the PDF by integration: \n    F(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^a f(u) \\ \\text{d}u\n\n\n\nAny function f(a) with the following properties defines a valid probability density function:\n\n\nNon-negativity: f(a) \\geq 0 for all a \\in \\mathbb R\n\n\nNormalization: \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(u) \\ \\text{d}u = 1\n\n\nThe support of a continuous random variable Y with PDF f is the set \\mathcal{Y} = \\{a \\in \\mathbb{R} : f(a) &gt; 0\\}, which contains all values where the density is positive.

Instead, the probability is given by the area under the PDF curve over an interval. The PDF value f(a) itself can be greater than 1, as long as the total area under the curve equals 1.\nIt is important to note that for continuous random variables, the probability of any single point is zero. This is why, as shown in the last rule above, the inequalities (strict or non-strict) don’t affect the probability calculations for intervals. This stands in contrast to discrete random variables, where the inclusion of endpoints can change the probability value.",

In contrast, the distribution of a coin flip should remain the same regardless of whether the person tossing the coin earns 15 or 20 EUR per hour.\nThe conditional cumulative distribution function (CCDF), F_{Y|Z=b}(a) = F_{Y|Z}(a|b) = P(Y\\leq a|Z=b), represents the distribution of a random variable Y given that another random variable Z takes a specific value b. It answers the question: “If we know that Z=b, what is the distribution of Y?”\nFor example, suppose that Y represents wage and Z represents education:\n\n\nF_{Y|Z=12}(a) is the CDF of wages among individuals with 12 years of education.\n\nF_{Y|Z=14}(a) is the CDF of wages among individuals with 14 years of education.\n\nF_{Y|Z=18}(a) is the CDF of wages among individuals with 18 years of education.\n\nSince wage is a continuous variable, its conditional distribution given any specific value of another variable is also continuous.

The conditional CDF of Y given Z_1 = b and Z_2 = c is: \nF_{Y|Z_1=b,Z_2=c}(a) = F_{Y|Z_1,Z_2}(a|b,c) = P(Y \\leq a|Z_1=b, Z_2=c).\n\nFor example:\n\n\nF_{Y|Z_1=10,Z_2=1}(a) is the CDF of wages among women with 10 years of experience.\n\nF_{Y|Z_1=10,Z_2=0}(a) is the CDF of wages among men with 10 years of experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Conditional CDFs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Conditional PDFs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Wage distributions conditional on 10 years of experience and gender\n\n\nClearly the random variable Y and the random vector (Z_1, Z_2) are dependent.\nMore generally, we can condition on the event that a k-variate random vector \\boldsymbol Z = (Z_1, \\ldots, Z_k)' takes the value \\{\\boldsymbol Z = \\boldsymbol b\\}, i.e., \\{Z_1 = b_1, \\ldots, Z_k = b_k\\}. The conditional CDF of Y given \\{\\boldsymbol Z = \\boldsymbol b\\} is \n  F_{Y|\\boldsymbol Z = \\boldsymbol b}(a) = F_{Y|Z_1 = b_1, \\ldots, Z_k = b_k}(a).\n\nThe variable of interest, Y, can also be discrete. Then, any conditional CDF of Y is also discrete. Below is the conditional CDF of education given the married dummy variable:\n\n\nF_{Y|Z=0}(a) is the CDF of education among unmarried individuals.\n\nF_{Y|Z=1}(a) is the CDF of education among married individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Conditional CDFs of education given married\n\n\nThe conditional PMFs \\pi_{Y|Z=0}(a) = P(Y = a | Z=0) and \\pi_{Y|Z=1}(a)= P(Y = a | Z=1) indicate the jump heights of F_{Y|Z=0}(a) and F_{Y|Z=1}(a) at a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Education given unmarried\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Education given married\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Conditional PMFs of education for unmarried (left) and married (right) individuals\n\n\nClearly, education and married are dependent random variables.

    "text": "1.9 Independence of Random Variables\nIn the previous section, we saw that the distribution of a coin flip remains the same regardless of a person’s marital status, illustrating the concept of independence. Let’s now formalize this important concept.\n\nIndependence\nY and Z are independent if and only if \n  F_{Y|Z=b}(a) = F_{Y}(a) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ a \\ \\text{and} \\ b.\n\n\n\nNote that if F_{Y|Z=b}(a) = F_{Y}(a) for all b, then automatically F_{Z|Y=a}(b) = F_{Z}(b) for all a. Due to this symmetry we can equivalently define independence through the property F_{Z|Y=a}(b) = F_{Z}(b).\n\nTechnical Note: More rigorously, the independence condition should state “for almost every b” rather than “for all b”. This means the condition must hold for every b in the support of Z, apart from a set of values that has probability 0 under Z. Put differently, the condition must hold for all b-values that Z can actually take, with exceptions allowed only on a set whose probability is 0. Think of it as “for all practical purposes”. For instance, we only need independence to hold for non-negative wages. We don’t need to check independence for negative wages since they can’t occur.\n\nFor discrete random variables, independence can be expressed using PMFs: Y and Z are independent if and only if \\pi_{Y|Z=b}(a) = \\pi_Y(a) for all a,b. Similarly, for continuous random variables, independence means the conditional PDF factorizes f_{Y|Z=b}(a) = f_Y(a).\nThe definition naturally generalizes to Z_1, Z_2, Z_3. They are mutually independent if, for each i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, the conditional distribution of Z_i given the other two equals its marginal distribution. In CDF form, this means:\n\nF_{Z_1|Z_2=b_2, Z_3=b_3}(a) = F_{Z_1}(a)\nF_{Z_2|Z_1=b_1, Z_3=b_3}(a) = F_{Z_2}(a)\nF_{Z_3|Z_1=b_1, Z_2=b_2}(a) = F_{Z_3}(a)\n\nfor all a and for all (b_1, b_2, b_3). Here, we need all three conditions.\n\nMutual Independence\nThe random variables Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n are mutually independent if and only if, for each i = 1,\\dots,n, \n  F_{Z_i | Z_1=b_1,\\ldots,Z_{i-1}=b_{i-1},\\,Z_{i+1}=b_{i+1},\\ldots,Z_n=b_n}(a)\n=\nF_{Z_i}(a).\n for all a and all (b_1, \\ldots, b_n).\n\n\nAn equivalent viewpoint uses the joint CDF of the vector \\boldsymbol Z = (Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n)', which is defined as: \n  F_{\\boldsymbol Z}(\\boldsymbol a) = F_{Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = P(Z_1 \\leq a_1, \\ldots, Z_n \\leq a_n) = P(\\boldsymbol Z \\leq \\boldsymbol a),\n where \nP(Z_1 \\leq a_1, \\ldots, Z_n \\leq a_n) = P(\\{Z_1 \\leq a_1\\} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\{Z_n \\leq a_n\\}).\n\nThen Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n are mutually independent if and only if the joint CDF is the product of the marginal CDFs: \n  F_{\\boldsymbol Z}(\\boldsymbol a) = F_{Z_1}(a_1) \\cdots F_{Z_n}(a_n) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ a_1, \\ldots, a_n.",
